## Overview

This document logs a successful test of the hybrid patient safety model based on clinical and systemic features from Hamburg emergency data.

The prototype integrates:
- `HamburgClinicalEncoder`: Feature extraction and normalization for multi-domain clinical signals
- `HybridSafetyModel`: Modular backbone (GRU or Transformer)
- Crisis, staff, and safety output heads for multi-task prediction

---

## Configuration

- `d_model`: 512  
- Backbone: `GRU` (can switch to `Transformer`)
- Batch size: 2  
- Sequence length: 16  
- Framework: `PyTorch`  
- Execution environment: `Kaggle notebook`  

---

## Synthetic Input

We generated artificial input tensors emulating the structure of patient pathways:
- 27 variables (e.g., vitals, demographics, crisis levels, crew state)
- Normalized using reasonable clinical heuristics
- Embedded categorical values (e.g. hospital, chief complaint)

## Model Output (sample)

| Key               | Shape         | Sample Value                     |
|------------------|---------------|----------------------------------|
| `crisis_logits`   | [2, 5]        | `[-0.06, -0.03, 0.13, -0.04, -0.03]` |
| `burnout`         | [2]           | `0.50`                           |
| `fatigue`         | [2]           | `0.98`                           |
| `retention`       | [2]           | `0.50`                           |
| `response_delay`  | [2]           | `0.02`                           |
| `quality`         | [2]           | `0.53`                           |
| `adverse_risk`    | [2]           | `0.48`                           |

All values are near baseline — expected due to random input and untrained weights.

## Notes

- ✅ Encoder correctly maps raw data to `d_model` dimension
- ✅ Backbone runs without memory issues or tensor shape mismatches
- ✅ Output heads generate semantically interpretable predictions

---

## Next Steps

- [ ] Swap GRU for Transformer backbone for comparison
- [ ] Integrate optional masking for padded sequences
- [ ] Prepare real dataset and training loop
- [ ] Evaluate feasibility of replacing backbone with Mamba once stable

_This test marks a critical milestone in validating the architectural stability of the hybrid model before exploring more complex temporal dynamics._
