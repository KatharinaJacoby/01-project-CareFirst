## 🗓️ Day 4 — Simplified Baseline Modeling for AI-Supported Patient Pathways (Hamburg)

This log documents the decisions and results of **Day 4** in the development of an AI-supported coordination model for patient pathways — focused on emergency medical services (EMS) and hospital handoffs in Hamburg, Germany.

---

### 🧭 Goals for Day 4

* **Finish the exploratory data inspection**
* **Remove overly synthetic features** (initial vitals)
* **Build a simple, explainable baseline model**
* Maintain a **robust, clinical perspective** and keep modeling grounded

---

### ✅ Key Changes

#### 🔹 Switched from Mamba to MLP

* Mamba was initially considered, but given the **demonstration scope** and the need for **debuggable simplicity**, we opted for a straightforward `MLP` model instead.
* No unnecessary complexity or hype: the goal is to **show that coordination can be modeled ethically and functionally**.

#### 🔹 Removed Initial Vitals

* EMS teams **actively treat patients**, so initial vitals are both **dynamic** and **misleading**.
* Final **triage code** from EMS was retained — representing the team's integrated assessment.
* This simplification aligns better with real-world triage processes and reduces noise in the model.

#### 🔹 Finalized Hospital List

* Simulated coordination across **major Hamburg hospitals** (UKE, Altona, Wandsbek, St. Georg, BG Boberg, etc.)
* Inpatient flow restricted to **UKE only**, for clarity and realistic specialization assumptions.
* Capacity signals are simulated per-hospital as IVENA-style availability.

---

### 🧠 Modeling Highlights

* Used an `MLP` with categorical + normalized features.
* Trained to predict `outputs_ward_assignment_suitability` (0–1 score).
* Train and validation losses decreased smoothly.
* Visual alignment between predicted vs. actual scores.

#### Losses:

```text
Final Train Loss ≈ 1.70
Final Val Loss ≈ 0.75
```

### 📊 Visualization Snapshot

* Distribution plots
* Boxplots (coordination time vs home type)
* Prediction scatter

The visualizations validated assumptions made during simulation and helped confirm basic realism.

---

### 🧱 Feature Inputs Used

* `age`, `sex`, `home_type`, `arrival_mode`, `suspected_condition`
* `ems_triage_code`
* `ivena_availability_*` (per hospital)

---

### 🏁 Current Status

* ✅ Exploratory data inspection complete
* ✅ Clean simulation + modeling baseline in place
* ✅ Full pipeline debugged and reproducible

---

### 🚧 Next Steps

* Add multi-task targets (e.g. coordination complexity, pathway latency)
* Continue adjusting simulation for realism (suspected conditions, triage outcomes)
* Document pathways for **critical vs. elective**, **pediatrics**, **OBGYN**
* Build transparent evaluation tools (prediction scatter, over/under-routing cases)

---

### 🤝 Contribution Goals

This is a **research-only**, **non-deployment** project shared publicly to:

* Offer clinically aligned alternatives to exploitative hospital coordination AI
* Share open notebooks, simulation code, and modeling steps
* Invite feedback and collaboration from both technical and medical communities
